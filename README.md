# UnWinnable Tic Tac Toe
- The name is a little miss-leading. This game is not UN-beatable, thie is UN-Winable. 
- A two hours challenge project. Developed a simple tic tac toe, which can be found in other repo called "TicTacToe", and had it in the back of my mind to develop an Uniwinnable. 
- Had to add Min-Max Algorithm. 
- Made a different repo for this one, because the other work is a little to naive. Plus this one is totally new project. 
- Secondly, it was a two hours challenge. I DID IT!
