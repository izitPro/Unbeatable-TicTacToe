# Un-Winnable Tic Tac Toe
- The name is a little miss-leading. This game is not UN-beatable; it's UN-Winable. 
- ONE HOUR CHALLEGNE. (took me a little more than that to be honest)
- Made a simple tic tac toe, which can be found in one of my other repos called "TicTacToe" - a naive project - and had it in the back of my head to make a newer version of that. Could've update the same repo, but let it be this way. Why not?
